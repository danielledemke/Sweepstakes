I used dependency injection in my Marketing Firm class, specifically in the constructor of the Marketing Firm class. The Marketing Firm object is dependent on which type of manager (stack or queue manager) is passed in and benefits the program by allowing flexibility of using any ISweepstakesManager type object. In the future, I would be able to create more data structures to inherit ISweepstakesManager interface and have the ability to use them with little change in any functionality of my code.
